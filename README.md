# mntoha-data-release
Thermal Optical Habitat Area data release

## Organization

Though we don't strictly adhere to these divisions, here's the general idea for the output folders:

* `out` contains git-committable yml or ind files that describe the existence of data files
* `out_data` contains data files that are directly posted to SB as-is
* `tmp` contains data files that we should be able to delete to save space without disrupting much pipeline progress
