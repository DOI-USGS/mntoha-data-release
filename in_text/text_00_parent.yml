  Data release: Walleye Thermal Optical Habitat Area (TOHA) of selected Minnesota lakes

abstract: >-
  <p>Climate change and land use change have been shown to influence lake temperatures and water clarity in different ways. To better understand the diversity of lake responses to
  climate change and give managers tools to manage individual lakes, we focused on improving prediction accuracy for daily water
  temperature profiles and opitical habitat in 909 lakes in Minnesota during 1980-2019.
  <br/>The data are organized into these items:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e5c1c1ce4b01d50924f27e7">Lake Information</a> - A lake metadata file and one shapefile of polygons for all 909 lakes in this study</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e5d0b68e4b01d50924f2b32">Observations</a> - Temperature observations for 903 of the 909 lakes used in this study</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e5c1c36e4b01d50924f27ea">Model Configurations</a> - Model parameters and metadata used to configure models</li>

  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e5d0bb9e4b01d50924f2b36">Model Predictions</a> - Predictions for water temperature and near-surface irradiance</li>
