  Data release: Walleye Thermal Optical Habitat Area (TOHA) of selected Minnesota lakes

abstract: >-
  <p>Climate change and land use change have been shown to influence lake temperatures and water clarity in different ways. To better understand the diversity of lake responses to 
  climate change and give managers tools to manage individual lakes, we focused on improving prediction accuracy for daily water 
  temperature profiles and opitical habitat in 909 lakes in Minnesota during 1980-2019.
  <br/>The data are organized into these items:</p>
  <ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e5c1c1ce4b01d50924f27e7">Spatial data</a> - A lake metadata file, and one shapefile of polygons for all 909 lakes in this study (.shp, .shx, .dbf, and .prj files)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e5c1c36e4b01d50924f27ea">Model configurations</a> - Model parameters and metadata used to configure models (1 JSON file, with metadata for each of 909 lakes, 
  and one zip file with each lake's glm3.nml file)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e5d0b68e4b01d50924f2b32">Observations</a> - </li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e5d0b96e4b01d50924f2b34">Model Inputs</a> - Data used to drive predictive models (13 files each for ice-flags, clarity, and daily meteorology)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5e5d0bb9e4b01d50924f2b36">Model Predictions</a> - Predictions from GLM3 and PGDL for water temperature (13 zip files), and near-surface irradiance from GLM3 (13 zip files)</li>
