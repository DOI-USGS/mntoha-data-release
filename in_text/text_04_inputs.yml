  Walleye Thermal Optical Habitat Area (TOHA) of selected Minnesota lakes: 4 Model inputs (meteorological inputs, clarity, and ice flags)

abstract: >-
  This dataset includes model inputs (specifically, weather, water clarity, and flags for predicted ice-cover) and is part of a larger data
  release of lake temperature model inputs and outputs for 881 lakes in the U.S. state of Minnesota (https://doi.org/10.5066/P9PPHJE2).

      A zip file containing a csv file for every lake within {group_id} with clarity data. Files within the
      zip are named "gam_{site_id}_clarity.csv", where `site_id` is the lake nhdhr id. Daily clarity estimates
      were generated by a Generalized Additive Model (by co-author K Vitense).

          These ice cover estimates were obtained by running GLM (Hipsey et al. 2019) and saving outputs at
          daily resolution (nsave = 1) and using the glmtools R package (also described in Hipsey et al. 2019) to
          extract hourly radiation just below the surface as simulated by the model (command was
          glmtools::get_var(nc_daily, var_name = 'hice')), and exporting a value of "TRUE" if hice was greater than zero.
