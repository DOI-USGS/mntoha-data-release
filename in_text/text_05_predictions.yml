  Walleye Thermal Optical Habitat Area (TOHA) of selected Minnesota lakes: 5 Model prediction data

abstract: >-
  Multiple modeling frameworks were used to predict daily temperatures at 0.5m depth intervals for a set of diverse lakes in the U.S.
  states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. Uncalibrated models used default configurations (PB0; see Read et al. 2019 for details) of the
  General Lake Model (Hipsey et al. 2019) and no parameters were further adjusted according to model fit with observations.
  Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL; see Read et al. 2019 and Jia et al. 2019) models were deep learning models pre-trained
  PB0 outputs and a physical constraint for energy conservation as a loss term.
  After pre-training, these PGDL models were training on actual temperature observations.

          These irradiance time series were obtained by running GLM (Hipsey et al. 2019) and saving outputs at
          hourly resolution (nsave = 1) and using the glmtools R package (also described in Hipsey et al. 2019) to
          extract hourly radiation just below the surface as simulated by the model (command was
          glmtools::get_var(nc_hourly, reference = 'surface', z_out = 0, var_name = 'rad')), and exporting a daily average.
          Since the model was driven by daily solar radiation (see "inputs" in data release), this rad_0 is very similar,
          but is meant to be the real solar radiation _within_ the water column, meaning minus what is reflected at the
          surface, absorbed immediately, or lost due to ice-cover. This variable was used for thermal optical habitat area
          calculations.
