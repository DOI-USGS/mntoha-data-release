  Walleye Thermal Optical Habitat Area (TOHA) of selected Minnesota lakes: 5 Model prediction data

abstract: >-
  Multiple modeling frameworks were used to predict daily temperatures at 0.5m depth intervals for a set of diverse lakes in the U.S.
  states of Minnesota and Wisconsin. Uncalibrated models used default configurations (PB0; see Winslow et al. 2016 for details) and no parameters were adjusted according to model fit with observations.
  Process-Guided Deep Learning (PGDL; see Read et al. 2019 and Jia et al. 2019) models were deep learning models pre-traied PB0 outputs and a physical constraint for energy conservation as a loss term.
  After pre-training, these PGDL models were training on actual temperature observations.
