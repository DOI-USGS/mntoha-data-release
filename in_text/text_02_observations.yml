  Walleye Thermal Optical Habitat Area (TOHA) of selected Minnesota lakes: 2 Water temperature observations

abstract: >-
  Observed water temperatures from 1980-2018 were compiled for 877 lakes in Minnesota (USA). There were four lakes included in
  this data release that did not have temperature observations available at the time of compilation or these data existed elsewhere
  and were unknown to the compilation team. These data were used
  as training, test, and error-estimation data for process-guided deep learning models and the evaluation of process-based models.
  The data are formatted as a single csv (comma separated values) file with attributes corresponding to the unique combination of
  lake identifier, time, and depth. Data came from a variety of sources, including the Water Quality Portal,
  the North Temperate Lakes Long-Term Ecological Research Project (NSF DEB-1440297), and digitized temperature
  records from the MN Department of Natural Resources.
  This dataset is part of a larger data release of lake temperature model inputs and outputs for 881 lakes in the U.S.
  state of Minnesota (https://doi.org/10.5066/P9PPHJE2).
