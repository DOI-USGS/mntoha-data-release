  Walleye Thermal Optical Habitat Area (TOHA) of selected Minnesota lakes: 7 thermal and optical habitat estimates

abstract: >-
  Climate change has been shown to influence lake temperatures in different ways. To better understand the diversity
  of lake responses to climate change and give managers tools to manage individual lakes, we focused on improving
  prediction accuracy for daily water temperature profiles in 881 lakes in Minnesota and Wisconsin during 1980-2019.
