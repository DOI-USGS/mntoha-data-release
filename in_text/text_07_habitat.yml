  Walleye Thermal Optical Habitat Area (TOHA) of selected Minnesota lakes: 7 thermal and optical habitat estimates

abstract: >-
  Using predicted lake temperatures from uncalibrated models (PB0) and process-guided deep learning models (PGDL), this
  dataset summarized a collection of thermal metrics to characterize lake temperature impacts on fish habitat for 881
  lakes. Included in the metrics are daily thermal optical habitat areas and a set of over 172 annual thermal metrics.

build-environment: >-
  This dataset was generated using the USGS Advanced Research Computing, USGS Yeti Supercomputer (https://doi.org/10.5066/F7D798MJ) and
  open source tools available in the R programming language (R version 3.6.3 (2020-02-29)).
  The computing platform for generating data and metadata was x86_64-redhat-linux-gnu.
  R packages loaded into this environment: purrr, version: 0.3.4; feather, version: 0.3.5; tidyr, version: 1.1.2;
